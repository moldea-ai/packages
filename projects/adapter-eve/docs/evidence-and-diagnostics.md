# Evidence and diagnostics

The adapter may emit `runtime-package`, `language`, `agent-definition`, `instruction-loader`, `schema`, `tool-registration`, `skill-registration`, and `handoff-registration` evidence. Dynamic or collided forms suppress optimistic evidence and any negative diagnostic that would require selecting an uncertain source.

## Stable diagnostics

| `EVE_INSTRUCTION_ROOT_CONFLICT`             | The Eve instruction slot contains conflicting authored sources.                           |

| `EVE_TOOL_NAME_INVALID`                     | The Eve filesystem tool name is invalid.                                                  |
| `EVE_TOOL_NAME_RESERVED`                    | The Eve filesystem tool name is reserved by the runtime.                                  |

| `EVE_TOOL_NAME_MISMATCH`                    | The declared tool name does not match the Eve path-derived runtime name.                  |

| `EVE_TOOL_OUTPUT_SCHEMA_NOT_WIRED`          | The declared tool output schema is not wired to the Eve tool definition.                  |
| `EVE_SKILL_IMPLEMENTATION_NOT_WIRED`        | The declared skill implementation is not the discovered Eve skill artifact.               |
| `EVE_SKILL_REGISTRATION_NOT_WIRED`          | The declared skill registration is not wired to the owning Eve agent.                     |

| `EVE_TOOL_SUBAGENT_NAME_COLLISION`          | The Eve tool and local subagent use the same runtime tool name.                           |
| `EVE_SUBAGENT_PARENT_AMBIGUOUS`             | Multiple registered Eve agents map to the local subagent's immediate parent root.         |
| `EVE_ROUTING_DESCRIPTION_MISSING`           | The supported Eve local subagent definition is missing its routing description.           |
| `EVE_ROUTING_DESCRIPTION_NOT_WIRED`         | The Eve local subagent description does not use the target effective routing description. |
| `EVE_RUNTIME_RELATIONSHIP_UNVERIFIED`       | The declared runtime relationship could not be verified.                                  |

Diagnostics never include source snippets, descriptions, instructions, schema contents, credentials, URLs, host paths, or raw TypeScript diagnostic messages.

`EVE_RUNTIME_RELATIONSHIP_UNVERIFIED` has severity `warning` only when the adapter identifies a declared relationship affected by a recognized but unresolved source candidate. Its safe details identify the relationship and reason; known version-behavior boundaries additionally carry normalized dependency context. Missing local evidence or a newer eligible dependency version alone does not produce this warning. Confirmed diagnostic codes remain errors.
