# Git working-tree source model

Git determines the absolute top-level working-tree root for the selected starting directory. Ordinary repositories, unborn repositories, nested invocation directories, and linked worktrees use this same discovery path. Bare repositories, Git-directory-only paths, sparse checkouts, malformed Git output, and unsupported versions fail before inventory begins.

## Inventory

`validate` and `inspect` read NUL-delimited tracked index records plus non-ignored untracked records using fixed, non-interactive Git commands. `scope` applies an exact top-level literal pathspec for `/moldea/moldea.yaml`; `content` applies one for the already validated canonical path. Selected commands therefore avoid whole-repository inventory cost. Every mode validates modes, stages, object identifiers, UTF-8 paths, ownership, and exact logical-path grammar before constructing the reader.

Submodule roots and their descendants are excluded. Untracked content owned by a nested repository is excluded. Missing candidates are omitted, while contradictory index stages, tracked/untracked collisions, unsupported types, unsafe paths, or ambiguous ownership fail atomically.

## Symlinks and content transforms

Native symlinks remain symlinks. When `core.symlinks=false`, tracked Git symlinks materialized as regular host files are overlaid as logical symlinks and never read as content.

The CLI classifies effective `filter`, `working-tree-encoding`, and `ident` attributes without executing filters, Git LFS, clean or smudge commands, or encoding helpers. A guarded regular file remains visible in the inventory but fails if Core requests its bytes, using the safe `git:GIT_CONTENT_TRANSFORM_UNSUPPORTED` contract.

## Stabilization

The selected working tree, worktree Git directory, and common Git directory are pinned by host identity. Each attempt compares the applicable complete or path-selected normalized inventories around exact-path reader construction and runs its operation only when they agree. Snapshot-related failures retry the whole provisional operation up to three total attempts; no provisional bytes or results are reused.

An unstable tree produces retryable `cli:WORKING_TREE_UNSTABLE`. Commands use observational Git operations only and preserve the worktree, real index, refs, `HEAD`, configuration, submodule state, and object-database state. The CLI never exposes selected host paths, raw process errors, Git stderr, or rejected values in its public errors.
