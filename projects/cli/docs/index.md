# The local package composition

`@moldea.ai/cli` provides the `moldea` executable. It discovers a selected Git working tree, derives an exact portable inventory, constructs a guarded filesystem snapshot, runs Core with active official adapters, and emits deterministic human or JSON results.

```bash
pnpm add --global @moldea.ai/cli
moldea validate
```

The package exposes no supported JavaScript or TypeScript import API. Its public contract is the executable, command grammar, output envelopes, status and exit semantics, safe operational errors, and runtime requirements.

## Composition

The CLI composes `@moldea.ai/repository`, `@moldea.ai/repository-fs`, `@moldea.ai/core`, and the currently active package-backed adapters. The `custom` runtime remains built into Core. The CLI reports only this installed executable composition and does not carry technical matrix targets or target maturity.

The Agent Skill consumes this local executable as its deterministic package layer. Complete skill installation, workflows, tutorials, target maturity, and qualification presentation belong to the separate public experiences; this documentation covers only the CLI contract.

## Boundaries

The executable performs no network requests, telemetry, repository writes, configured Git content transforms, runtime SDK calls, or model calls. It uses read-only Git operations and no-follow filesystem observations. Core and adapter results preserve their owning contracts rather than being reinterpreted by the CLI.
