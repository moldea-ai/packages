# `@moldea.ai/adapter-vercel-ai-sdk`

Deterministic runtime evidence and diagnostics for Vercel AI SDK `ToolLoopAgent`, `generateText`, and `streamText` integrations declared by `moldea` agents.

The package implements the official `vercel-ai-sdk` runtime adapter for `@moldea.ai/core`. It statically inspects explicitly bound repository source through Core's source-neutral reader. It never imports or calls the Vercel AI SDK, requires no API key, executes no repository code, and makes no network request.

## Supported targets

Version `1.0.3` supports:

- Repository Format version `1`
- `@moldea.ai/core ^2.0.0`
- TypeScript ESM `.ts`, `.tsx`, and `.mts` source
- npm `ai >=7.0.66 <8.0.0`
- directly exported `ToolLoopAgent` definitions
- directly exported functions containing direct `generateText({ ... })` or `streamText({ ... })` calls
- direct instruction-loader wiring through `instructions` and the closed direct-generation `system` fallback
- ToolLoopAgent input schemas through `callOptionsSchema`
- agent output schemas through `Output.object({ schema })`
- repository-local function tools declared through `tool({ ... })`
- closed object-map tool registration with runtime identity derived from each map key
- direct tool implementation, input-schema, and output-schema relationships

Named value imports from the `ai` package root and their aliases are supported. Relative ESM named imports resolve exact TypeScript paths plus `.js` to `.ts` or `.tsx` and `.mjs` to `.mts`. Relationship closure is independent: a dynamic relationship does not erase another relationship proved from the same configuration.

The Runtime Compatibility Matrix is authoritative for exact versions, evidence, binding support, patterns, and known limitations.

## Usage

```typescript
import { vercelAiSdkAdapter } from '@moldea.ai/adapter-vercel-ai-sdk';
import { createCore } from '@moldea.ai/core';

const core = createCore({ adapters: [vercelAiSdkAdapter] });
```

The local CLI bundles active official adapters automatically. Applications composing Core directly register the immutable singleton explicitly.

## Public exports

The package exports only `vercelAiSdkAdapter`. It has no default export, configuration factory, diagnostic registry, SDK facade, parser export, provider registry, tool runtime, or mutable state.

## Evidence

The verified targets may emit `runtime-package`, `language`, `agent-definition`, `runtime-pattern`, `instruction-loader`, `schema`, and `tool-registration` evidence. Schema details identify the `agent-input`, `agent-output`, `tool-input`, or `tool-output` role. Tool runtime names come from exact supported tools-map keys.

Evidence is source-grounded, references existing regular files, and contains no repository contents, instructions, descriptions, credentials, model identifiers, tool arguments, provider configuration, request or response payloads, or model output.

Missing local runtime evidence is not a diagnostic. Dynamic, prepared, mutated, unsupported, or otherwise unresolved forms produce partial or no evidence rather than guessed failures.

## Development

From the monorepo root:

```bash
pnpm --filter @moldea.ai/adapter-vercel-ai-sdk test
pnpm --filter @moldea.ai/adapter-vercel-ai-sdk typecheck
pnpm --filter @moldea.ai/adapter-vercel-ai-sdk lint
pnpm --filter @moldea.ai/adapter-vercel-ai-sdk build
```

Unit and integration tests are colocated with their implementation modules. Adapter conformance fixtures live under `/fixtures/adapter-vercel-ai-sdk`.
