# Boundaries and limitations

The current verified targets do not claim support for:

- JavaScript, Python, CommonJS, or source outside the verified TypeScript ESM boundary
- indirect generation wrappers, request variables, nested callback calls, or generation APIs other than `generateText` and `streamText`
- `WorkflowAgent`, custom `Agent` implementations, factories, subclasses, or mutable definitions
- `Output.array`, `Output.choice`, `Output.json`, `Output.text`, or custom output implementations
- dynamic tools, provider tools, MCP-generated tools, inline tools as manifest registration identities, or mutated tools maps
- agent input schemas for direct generation wrappers
- `prepareCall` or `prepareStep` function-body interpretation
- routing, handoffs, subagents, workflow edges, provider identity, or model identity
- arbitrary compiler resolution, `tsconfig` path aliases, directory indexes, package exports, or re-export graphs
- runtime-generated strings, schema-content validation, provider compatibility, model behavior, or actual tool execution

Package detection uses nearest manifests, not lockfiles or installed `node_modules`. Static dependency ranges are observations; the adapter does not prove which package build executes at runtime.

Each invocation sees one declared agent and only the bounded operations Core supplies through `IRuntimeAdapterRepository`. It receives no complete agent collection, project body index, host path, credential, environment variable, network client, or runtime process. It does not execute TypeScript, dynamically import source, load the inspected SDK, or follow source symlinks.

The [Runtime Compatibility Matrix](/compatibility/) remains authoritative. A focused specification or future design does not broaden this page until the canonical matrix and released implementation do.
