# Boundaries and limitations

The current verified target does not claim support for:

- JavaScript, Python, CommonJS, or source outside the verified TypeScript ESM boundary
- `@openai/agents-core`, `@openai/agents-realtime`, sandbox agents, or subpath imports
- custom `Handoff` construction, dynamically assembled agent graphs, or manager-style agents as tools
- hosted, MCP-generated, namespaced, or tool-search tools
- arbitrary compiler resolution, `tsconfig` path aliases, directory indexes, package exports, or re-export graphs
- runtime-generated or transformed routing descriptions
- omitted function-tool names or names requiring SDK normalization
- schema-content validation
- handoff input schemas, callbacks, filters, enablement, runtime variables, guardrails, prompt templates, sessions, tracing, approvals, models, or provider behavior

Package detection uses nearest manifests, not lockfiles or installed `node_modules`. Static dependency ranges are observations; the adapter does not prove which package build executes at runtime.

Each invocation sees one declared agent, exact same-runtime binding resolution, and only the bounded operations Core supplies through `IRuntimeAdapterRepository`. It receives no complete agent collection, project body index, host path, OpenAI credential, environment variable, network client, or runtime process. It does not execute TypeScript, dynamically import source, load the inspected SDK, or follow source symlinks. These constraints preserve deterministic, source-grounded behavior while deliberately leaving dynamic runtime semantics unresolved.

The [Runtime Compatibility Matrix](/compatibility/) remains authoritative. A focused specification or future design does not broaden this page until the canonical matrix and released implementation do.
