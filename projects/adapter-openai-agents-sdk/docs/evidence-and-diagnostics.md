# Evidence and diagnostics

## Evidence

The verified target may emit `agent-definition`, `handoff-registration`, `instruction-loader`, `language`, `runtime-package`, `schema`, and `tool-registration` evidence. Records are grounded in existing logical source references and may identify the relevant agent, capability, target agent, configuration property, schema role, or routing-description source.

Agent-definition evidence uses the exact supported static Agent name only when it satisfies Core's non-empty, single-line, NUL-free, Unicode-scalar machine-string contract without surrounding Repository Format whitespace. Otherwise it uses the bound runtime-agent symbol. A target Agent name that cannot satisfy the same contract is omitted from handoff details.

Handoff evidence maps a target only when exactly one registered `moldea` agent has the detected runtime binding. It reports a runtime name only for a supported static, non-empty `toolNameOverride` representable as a Core machine string. The adapter does not invent a manifest handoff graph or SDK-generated default name.

Evidence contains no repository content, instructions, descriptions, credentials, API keys, tool arguments, provider payloads, or model responses. Missing local evidence is not itself a diagnostic.

## Diagnostic catalog

Diagnostics use Core's shared adapter shape, preserve logical source locations, and remain deterministically ordered. Dynamic or indirect patterns yield partial or no evidence rather than guessed failures. Core validates adapter output and applies all-or-nothing inspection semantics.

## Package detection

Detection stops at the nearest existing `package.json` owning each runtime-agent source. Supported dependency fields are considered collectively. A collectively disjoint range produces the unsupported-version diagnostic without package evidence; an ambiguous range remains evidence rather than being promoted to verified support. Invalid UTF-8 or NUL in the owning manifest produces only `OPENAI_AGENTS_SDK_PACKAGE_MANIFEST_INVALID`; source text failures remain source diagnostics.

`OPENAI_AGENTS_SDK_RUNTIME_RELATIONSHIP_UNVERIFIED` has severity `warning` only when the adapter identifies a declared relationship affected by a recognized but unresolved source candidate. Its safe details identify the relationship and reason; known version-behavior boundaries additionally carry normalized dependency context. Missing local evidence or a newer eligible dependency version alone does not produce this warning. Confirmed diagnostic codes remain errors.
