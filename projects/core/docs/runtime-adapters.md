# Runtime adapters

Runtime adapters extend deterministic repository interpretation for one approved runtime. They inspect source already exposed by the supplied repository reader; they are not runtime SDK wrappers and do not execute an agent.

```typescript
import { createCore } from '@moldea.ai/core';
import type { IRuntimeAdapter } from '@moldea.ai/core/adapter';

export const createRuntimeAwareCore = (adapter: IRuntimeAdapter) => {
  return createCore({ adapters: [adapter] });
};
```

## Built-in `custom`

`custom` is recognized and validated by Core without a separate package. Repository Format permits project-local runtime guidance to be omitted, while the Runtime Compatibility Matrix requires appropriate guidance before a custom runtime receives a supported production-readiness claim because no provider-specific adapter can infer that integration. `custom` must never be installed or documented as `@moldea.ai/adapter-custom`.

## Invocation lifecycle

Core validates and detaches adapter definitions during `createCore`. During inspection it completes universal validation, checks that declared package-backed adapters are registered and support the repository format, then invokes active adapters in deterministic ID order with the immutable provisional project, matching agents, budget-aware reader, and shared cancellation signal.

An adapter returns evidence plus adapter diagnostics. Core validates every result, enforces output limits, normalizes ordering, and creates the final result. A thrown adapter error or malformed output becomes `ADAPTER_EXECUTION_FAILED`; partial evidence or diagnostics from the failed run are not exposed.

## Evidence

Evidence records source-grounded observations such as a runtime package, language, runtime pattern, instruction-loader wiring, schema wiring, or tool registration. Records identify logical sources and relevant agents or capabilities without including repository content, secrets, model input, tool arguments, or provider payloads.

The [Runtime Compatibility Matrix](/compatibility/) is the authority for approved adapter IDs, implementation state, evidence kinds, binding support, supported patterns, provider limits, and verification dates. The packages website assigns target maturity separately and does not change Core or adapter behavior.
