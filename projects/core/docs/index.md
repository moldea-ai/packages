# Deterministic repository interpretation

`@moldea.ai/core` is the source-neutral interpretation layer for the `moldea` repository format. It accepts caller-supplied text or an `IRepositoryReader`, validates the universal repository contract, matches changed paths against declared relationships, creates an immutable project index, and invokes explicitly configured runtime adapters only after universal validation succeeds.

Core never discovers or reads a filesystem, Git provider, or network on its own. This boundary keeps repository acquisition in reader packages and local composition in the CLI.

## Repository Format

Core is the deterministic reference implementation of Repository Format version `1`. The [official Repository Format specification](/repository-format/) defines every canonical file, manifest property, validation boundary, and conformance rule. The separate skill guide provides introductory adoption guidance. This package documentation covers the parsing, validation, indexing, diagnostics, and adapter behavior that implements the format.

## Available now

- strict text normalization and normalized SHA-256 content digests
- all-or-nothing Repository Format version 1 manifest and decision parsing
- content-free changed-path matching for exact relationships and simple globs
- canonical repository discovery and complete project inspection
- immutable project indexes and deterministic diagnostic ordering
- built-in `custom` runtime validation
- all-or-nothing invocation of configured package-backed runtime adapters
- bounded repository reads, diagnostics, and adapter evidence

## Entry points

- `@moldea.ai/core` exposes Core construction, results, diagnostics, limits, and exceptions.
- `@moldea.ai/core/format` exposes Repository Format value contracts.
- `@moldea.ai/core/adapter` exposes the runtime-adapter extension contract.

Core does not own source discovery, repository writes, Git behavior, runtime execution, provider API calls, model calls, or semantic Assurance judgments. Use the generated [API reference](./api/) for the exact public surface.
