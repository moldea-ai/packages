# Boundaries and limitations

The current verified target does not claim support for:

- JavaScript, Python, CommonJS, or source outside the verified TypeScript ESM boundary
- indirect query wrappers, query input variables, nested callback calls, or unstable session APIs
- filesystem-defined agents, built-in agents, observer agents, or dynamically assembled definitions
- query main-thread `agent` selection or `toolAliases` interpretation
- string-array system prompts, CLAUDE.md, settings, hooks, plugins, skills, or prompt transformations
- programmatic-subagent output schemas or manifest tool output schemas
- per-agent MCP server configuration
- external stdio, SSE, HTTP, remote, proxy, plugin, provider-hosted, or built-in tools
- SDK server instructions as canonical moldea instruction-loader content
- arbitrary compiler resolution, `tsconfig` path aliases, directory indexes, package exports, or re-export graphs
- runtime-generated strings, SDK key normalization, schema-content validation, permission evaluation, or provider behavior

Package detection uses nearest manifests, not lockfiles or installed `node_modules`. Static dependency ranges are observations; the adapter does not prove which package build executes at runtime.

Each invocation sees one declared agent, exact same-runtime binding resolution, and only the bounded operations Core supplies through `IRuntimeAdapterRepository`. It receives no complete agent collection, project body index, host path, Anthropic credential, environment variable, network client, or runtime process. It does not execute TypeScript, dynamically import source, load the inspected SDK, or follow source symlinks.

The [Runtime Compatibility Matrix](/compatibility/) remains authoritative. A focused specification or future design does not broaden this page until the canonical matrix and released implementation do.
